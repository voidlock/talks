## Tips
### - Be serious
### - Be thoughtful
### - Be present
]

.right-column[
Wherever you are, try to work a set schedule so others can rely on you for help.

If you're spread over timezones, try to ensure at least some part of your day overlaps with the rest of the team so they can include you in any realtime discussions.

.right-column[
Keep a Daily Journal

* Post what you're working on
* How you're feeling about it
* Challenges your facing.

There are tools that can help with this. https://idonethis.com/

Alternatively, hold regular retro's and be brutally honest
]

???

* This works well across a broader audience as well. Cross-team project announcements/wrap-ups etc.
* My team does standup every morning. We only cover:
  * Interesting (personal or work)
  * Blockers

.left-column[
## More Tips
### - Group chat
]

.right-column[
Get everyone into a group chat product like [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com/), [Hipchat](https://www.hipchat.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/), etc.

* Keep the atmosphere light
  * Talk about fun stuff, not just work
  * Use emoji
  * Share pics
* Create company wide space to share fun things
* Create company wide space(s) to ask general questions

This is a slightly more synchronous form of communication than email, but it is still asynchronous.
* Don't expect instantaneous replies.
* Keep your team in the loop about what you're up too.
* Maintain your presence, toggle between Away, DnD, Online.
]

???

* Create company wide space(s) to ask general questions
  * Heroku has
    * Lounge - General chat
    * Engineering - Engineering specific chat
    * Interest specific rooms
      * Golang
      * Splunk
      * Docker
      * etc
* Maintain your presence
  * This helps manage the expectations of others

.left-column[
## More Tips
### - Group chat
### - Face Time
]

.right-column[

It's important to see faces throughout your day.

Create a dedicated Google hangout with your team.
* Doesn't have to be a specific topic, just catchup on what you're working on and chat a bit.
* Use it for pair programming

Have regular 1 on 1s with management via Google hangouts, etc.
  * Check if you're meeting expectations.
  * Complain if they aren't meeting your expectations

Hold regular team meetups at conferences, headquarters or a central location.
]

???

* Team meetups
  * Great for reconnecting and re-energizing you for more remote work.

.left-column[
## More Tips
### - Group chat
### - Face Time
### - Scheduling
]

.right-column[
Scheduling is hard when you cannot physically see your team mates.

* Maintain a shared calendar for the team with time off and appointments.
* Maintain an up to date personal calendar and share it with the team.
* Peek at the schedules of your team mates every so often.
  * This helps you keep things intimate, "How did your meetup go last night?"
]

???

* Helps keep everyone informed about time contrainsts.
* In an office it's easy to see, "Oh Matt isn't in today", "not at his desk atm", etc

---

.left-column[
## More Tips
### - Group chat
### - Face Time
### - Scheduling
### - Stop working
]

.right-column[
Make sure that you start and stop work just like any regular office job employee would.

* It's easy to get carried away on a problem and put in extra hours.
* If you're in a timezone ahead of everyone else, it's easy to get into the trap of responding during your off hours. .red[__Don't__]

__Maintain a healthy work/life balance.__
]

???

* Unless you get paid for these, pick an end time to your day and stick to it.
* This is where a dedicated work space at home or work laptop helps.

.left-column[
## More Tips
### - Group chat
### - Face Time
### - Scheduling
### - Stop working
### - Socialize
]

.right-column[
After a while of sleeping, eating and working in the same place. That place becomes a very lonely place.

* Lunch with your family or meet friends
* Have a coffee break with friends at a coffee shop
* Get out in the evenings
* Join a meetup
* Create a meetup
* Take vacations and get away

We are all social beings. So spend time with family and friends.
