# Tips For Working A Remote Job

---

# Treat it as seriously as any other job.
* Put on nice clothes
* Go out and get a coffee
* Create a work-only space in your home.
* Whatever it takes to get into work mode.

---

# Be present

* Wherever you are, try to work a set schedule so others can rely on you for help.
* If you're spread over timezones, try to ensure at least some part of your day overlaps with the rest of the team so they can include you in any realtime discussions.

---

# Overshare

Make up for the lack of casual exchanges around the office.

---

# Group chat

* Get everyone into a group chat product.
* Make a space to talk about fun stuff, not just work.
* Keep your team in the loop about what you're up too.

???

* My team does standup every morning. We only cover:
  * Interesting (personal or work)
  * Blockers

---

# Daily Journals
* Post what you're working on
* How you're feeling about it
* Challenges your facing.

???

* This works well across a broader audience as well. Cross-team project announcements/wrap-ups etc.

---

# Regular Face Time

* A dedicated Google hangouts with your team.
* Regular 1 on 1s with management via Google hangouts.
  * Check if you're meeting expectations.
  * Complain if they aren't meeting your expectations
* Regular team meetups at conferences, headquarters or a central location.

???

* Team Hangout
  * Doesn't have to be a specific topic, just catchup on what you're working on and chat a bit.
  * Use it for pair programming
* Team meetups
  * Great for reconnecting and re-energizing you for more remote work.

---

# Scheduling

* Maintain a shared calendar for the team with time off and appointments.
* Maintain an up to date personal calendar and share it with the team.

???

* Helps keep everyone informed about time contrainsts.
* In an office it's easy to see, "Oh Matt isn't in today", "not at his desk atm", etc

---

# Stop working

It's easy to get carried away on a problem and put in extra hours.

If you're in a timezone ahead of everyone else, it's easy to get into the trap of responding during your off hours. __Don't__

???

* Unless you get paid for these, pick an end time to your day and stick to it.
* This is where a dedicated work space at home or work laptop helps.

---

# Connectivity is everything

People aren't very sympathetic when you can't find good enough wifi for a meeting.

Be careful not to be overly ambitious in roaming when remote working.

Get a faster internet connection from home. Some companies will even help you out with this.

# Converting your job to remote

---
template: converting

* If management has already been burned by someone abusing a work from home or remote working policy, good luck!

---
template: converting

* Buy copies of [Remote: Office Not Required](http://37signals.com/remote/) and spread them around the office.

---
template: converting

* Push management to allow for some flex days to work from home.
 * Prove to them it won't affect productivity.

---

* Move away! But ask them to stay on as a remote worker.
